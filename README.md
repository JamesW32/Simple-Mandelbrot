# Simple-Mandelbrot
A standard Mandelbrot

This code is a foundation for a standard Mandelbrot code that was made through C++. Since this was made i've progressed alot so the code might be very weird so i apologise for that. Basically this code utilizes 3 seperate threads to delevop an image of a mandelbrot with variable sizes of images and times the process. I did this for one of my modules for uni and have plans to continue working on this with possibilities to zoom into the image and update as it goes.

The reason this was built was to test mandelbrot processing times from different amounts of threads (Initially 1, 2 and 3) and how it effects the hardware.

FYI:- This was used for Academic reasons and was my personal submission so please dont steal from this.
